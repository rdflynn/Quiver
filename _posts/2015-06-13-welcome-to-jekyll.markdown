Welcome to the Quiver repository. 

Quiver is a game demo made in Unreal Engine 4, for use by students of University of Greenwich. 

As this is a demo, it should not be treated as a full game. It WILL have bugs, and it WILL change over time - hence the Github repository!

Any questions on any aspect of Quiver should be directed to Ryan Flynn via email or the associated Quiver GitHub page.
